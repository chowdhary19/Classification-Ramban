# Classification-Ramban: Generic Classification Models Repository

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Welcome to Classification-Ramban! This collection provides generic code templates for various classification models, ideal for data scientists and analysts looking to streamline their workflow.

## Description

This repository features templates for the following classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Kernel SVM


These templates are designed to be easily adaptable. Simply replace the CSV file name, ensuring your dataset has the last column as the dependent variable (target) and all other columns as features. Note that data preprocessing like encoding and handling missing values is not included in these templates.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chowdhary19/Classification-Ramban.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Classification-Ramban
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Replace the CSV file name in the code templates with your dataset. Ensure your dataset follows these requirements:
   - The last column should be the dependent variable (target).
   - All other columns should be features.

2. Run the desired classification model script:
   ```bash
   python logistic_regression.py
   ```
   Replace `logistic_regression.py` with the script you want to run.

## Example

```python
# Example for Logistic Regression

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Split into features and target
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]
y = data.iloc[:, -1]

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

## Important Note

- Ensure your dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before using these templates. This includes encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.
